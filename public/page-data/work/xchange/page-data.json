However, it turned out that Facebook was still the preferred channel to update such information, so plans were made to revamp this website. While redesigning the website to align more with a modern style, the new purpose of the website was also to serve as a media package, which would aid members in introducing XChange to potential partners.</p><p>With the help of two XChange members as a designer and a PM, the website was completed within 2 months. Since the old website was built on VueJS, it was more efficient to continue building under the same framework. Therefore, I learned how to write in VueJS and utilize existing plugins, such as vue-i18n.</p>","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAGCAIAAABM9SnKAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAAnklEQVQY02P4jwH+/fsHJN88uHv78O4bpw6+fHgHLogGGND4P3/+/PbtG5Bx+9zxQxsXnz9z/fmzN4Q1//37F0ju3r17x46dQMa9xw83H967fPWhy9cfE2Uz0M7z588fO3YcaP/lq9e6J0ycPH3GxUuXiNIMVPH792+Is+8/eLhx8+YFi5dcuXqVWD/DwadPH588eXzg0KH7Dx7g0gwAYtlUiX9FdFcAAAAASUVORK5CYII=","aspectRatio":3.3333333333333335,"src":"/static/5f629484b22ef4f8c25d65740b39a3a2/ee604/xchange.png","srcSet":"/static/5f629484b22ef4f8c25d65740b39a3a2/69585/xchange.png 200w,\n/static/5f629484b22ef4f8c25d65740b39a3a2/497c6/xchange.png 400w,\n/static/5f629484b22ef4f8c25d65740b39a3a2/ee604/xchange.png 800w,\n/static/5f629484b22ef4f8c25d65740b39a3a2/f3583/xchange.png 1200w,\n/static/5f629484b22ef4f8c25d65740b39a3a2/5707d/xchange.png 1600w,\n/static/5f629484b22ef4f8c25d65740b39a3a2/ed396/xchange.png 2000w","sizes":"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/xchange"}}}
